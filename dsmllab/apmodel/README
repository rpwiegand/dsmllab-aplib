This project implements a slightly augmented form of Bill & Dina
Spears' work on physicomimetic models for controlling teams of agents.
This is a generic MASON package, one is meant to use it to construct
more elaborate simulations.

At present, the project should contain the following files:

 ./apmodel
   ./APExperimentParameters.java  Loads high-level experiment params,
                                  points to AP model params file,
                                  tells what measures to load, etc. 
   ./APModel.java                 Main model code
   ./APModelWithUI.java           Code for visualizing the model
   ./APParser.java                Code for parsing detialed AP model
                                  parameters for the simulation.
                                  Defines particle types & interactions
   ./AbstractMeasure.java         Abs base class for defining measures
                                  for the simulation
   ./ForceInteractionModel.java   Graph-based model for defining
                                   interactions of forces in system
   ./ForceLaw.java                Base class for implementing force law
   ./LennardJonesForceLaw.java    Implements LJ physics
   ./MeasureRegistry.java         A registry for holding and dealing
                                  with any measures
   ./NewtonianForceLaw.java       Implements Newtonian physics
   ./Parsable.java                Interface defining objects parsable to
                                  APParser
   ./Particle.java                Base class for all agents


Also included are the following:
   ./README                       This file.
   ./apmodel.exp                  Experiment file for the APModel
   ./apmodel.params               Simple example model parameters file
   ./apmodel2.params              Moreo complicated example

The simulation is uses the MASON toolkit by Sean Luke (ver. 10, I
think).  I have placed it in a package called dsmllab for now.  It
relies on another package, dsmllab.utilities.  You should setup your
classpath appropriately.  The visualization program can be run at the
command-line using the following command:

  java dsmllab.apmodel.APModelWithUI

To run the model using specific parameters, specify the name of the
parameter file in the experiment file, and specify which experiment
file to use at the command line.  That is, create a file with a .exp
extension, which contains (at least) the parameter:

  apParamFileName=[parameter filename]

The program can then be run by typing the line below.  The program
will run as before, but the UI parameters will be ignored.  To see
what the program believes are the parameters, you can press the
"Refresh" button on the "Model" tab in the control window.
Subsequently changing the parameters will (for the most part) have no
effect.

  java dsmllab.apmodel.APModelWithUI [experiment filename]

You can also run it at the command line, without the display as
follows.

  java dsmllab.apmodel.APModel [experiment filename]
